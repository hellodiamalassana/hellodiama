        <h2>About me</h2>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I studied Automatic Control Engineering, since then I love programming, specifically web development. Currently, I dedicate myself to "Frontend" with Javascript and it's definitely my thing. I've been working with technologies like React, Angular, Vue, LitElement & Polymer 3; in addition to many others a little more specific. I love studying new tech and if I had time I would master them all.</p>
